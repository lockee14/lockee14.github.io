    <h1>Double bitwise NOT in javascript.</h1>

    <p>
        As you probably know double bitwise NOT operator can be used to convert a value of type string representing a number "1" to a value of type number 1. <br>
        The operation is faster and the notation is shorter but less readable than with parseInt() or parseFloat() which is the usual way to perform such a conversion, 
        another caveat is that the string representing a number must be in the range of a 32-bit integer thus from -2147483648 to 2147483647, 
        also any decimal part will be lost.
    </p>

    <p>But the question I was asking myself is, how it works? Let's find out by digging the official ecmascript documentation.</p>

    <p>Before performing any bit flipping of the value wich the bitwise NOT operator is applied to it will check if the value is a 32-bit integer, if not it converts the value to a 32-bit integer following these steps:</p>

    <img alt="bitwise not javascript" src="{{ "/assets/img/Double_bitwise_not_in_javascript/toint32.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />

    <p>If the value is not a javascript number(float64) it will follow the step one and convert it to a javascript number following these specification:</p>
    
    <img alt="bitwise not javascript" src="{{ "/assets/img/Double_bitwise_not_in_javascript/tonumber.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />

    <p>So for what concerns us we should look at toNumber for string wich say.</p>

    <img alt="bitwise not javascript" src="{{ "/assets/img/Double_bitwise_not_in_javascript/tonumberappliedtostring.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />

    <p>The value of the string must comply with the specification of a StringNumericLiteral otherwise ToNumber will return NaN.</p>

    <p>Step two if number is NaN, +0, -0, +∞, or -∞, it return +0.</p>

    <p>Step three of ToInt32 any decimal part will be truncated like with floor(abs(number)).</p>

    <p>Step four apply a modulo operation of 2^32 to the value because the value must fit in a 32-bit integer.</p>

    <img alt="bitwise not javascript" src="{{ "/assets/img/Double_bitwise_not_in_javascript/xmoduloy.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />

    <p>Step five ToInt32 return a signed 32-bit integer thus if the value is superior or equal to 2^31 it will return a negative number (our value - 2^32).</p>

    <p>Now our value is properly converted to an 32-bit integer so the bit are flipped, therefore if our initial value is "0": ~"0" === -1, then ~-1 === 0. <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup></p>

    <p>The bitwise NOT operator return a 32int that is stored as a float64 since numbers in javascript are of type float64.</p>

    <p>This is all for today I hope it can satisfy you as much as it satisfied myself, see you.</p>

        <p>Notes:</p>
        <ul class="note footnote">
            <li id="1">
                32-bit integer have 2^31 positive value including 0, thus it can represent integers from 0 until 2147483647 (2^31 - 1) and there is 2^31 negative value from -1 until -2147483648.<br>
                The minimum negative value is -1 represented in binary as 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111.<br>
                The minimum positive value is 0 represented in binary as 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000.<br>
                Thus after flipping all the bit ~0 === -1.<br>
