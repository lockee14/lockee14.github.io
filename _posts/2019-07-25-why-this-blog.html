    <h1>Why this blog?</h1>

    <p>
        This blog is dedicated to my own research on programming-related subjects.
        Whenever I need to search extensively to get an answer about something I will put what I have found and the resources that
        helped here as an archive. 
        It is also intended for me to be able to keep a track of my own research and put them back into memory if needed.
    </p>

        If it can also be useful to others it will be more than I expected and will make my day.
        Also if you notice any error, want to ask a question or just want to say hello don't hesitate to contact me by mail
        or in the comments section below each post.
    </p>

    <p> Thank you for reading this first post, see you in anothers one.</p>
